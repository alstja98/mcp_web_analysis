In a real implementation, this directory would contain:

1. favicon.ico - Naver favicon
2. sp_main.png - Main sprite sheet containing various icons and UI elements 
3. sprite_icons.png - Secondary sprite sheet for icon elements
4. banner1.png, banner2.png, banner3.png - Banner images 
5. media1.png through media24.png - News media logos

For a complete implementation, you would need to either create these images or use your own placeholder images.
The CSS is already set up to reference these files with the proper paths.
